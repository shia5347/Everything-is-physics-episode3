<h3>The three things I learned * 3 the questions(part 1)</h3>

<h4>Basics of work</h4>

<img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/c3S01Vm8kMMdwe5lYu3yrhMrVF1gMqc0dOHNu7JqKtE9KBARRP9z7neN-QlFsTbVW8Sy_GBrrNTH95lfwYr63Q85">

<p>For the basics of work, I have learned that work is measured in unit of 'Joules' - that has been originated from honouring <b>James Prescott Joule</b>. For calculating the work based off throwing an object, I know to use the equation <b>"W = FcosΘ(deltaDistance)"</b> where <b>F</b> is the magnitude of the force, <b>(deltaDistance)</b> is the distance from the throwing object's starting position and "lifting off" position", and finally <b>cosΘ</b> the angle between the throw direction and distance. However for pushing an object against a slope, the <b>cosΘ</b> would be changed to a <b>sinΘ</b>.</p>

<h4>Mechanical work (still the basics)</h4>

<p>I have learned that something can be considered a "Mechanical work" if there is both <b>Displacement</b> and <b>Force</b> properties on an moving object.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>
<ul>
	<li>- How does sin and cos more specifically effect the equation for Work.</li>
	<li>- Why is James Prescott Joule honoured</li>

<p>Energy can not be created or destroyed, but can be transfered from one form to another</p>

<h3>The three things I learned * 4 and questions(part 2)</h3>

<h4>
	<a name= "GPE">Gravitational Potential Energy basics</a>	
</h4>

<p>The Gravitational Potential energy is the Potential energy stored in an object that is being held up (being held away from the ground), where its potential energy depends on factors like height and mass of object.</p>

<b>Example</b>

<h4>Determining the work for falling or moving object</h4>

<p>For a moving object you would simply, use the equation <b>W = Fg(delta height)</b>, where <b>(delta height)</b> represents the speed of object and <b>Fg</b> the natural gravity force. For the falling object you would start the equation with <b>(delta Eg)</b> since work = <b>(delta Eg)</b>. The equation is <b>(delta Eg) = mg(deltaHeight)</b>.</p>
